## Notes

_Quick ideas, raw thoughts, things to research_

- Consider OpenSnow or NOAA integration for weather data
- Mobile app wrapper (PWA or React Native) for better mobile experience?
- Notification system for tour responses, forecast changes
- **Multi-activity architecture decision**: Single platform preferred over micro-sites
  - Single login, cross-activity discovery, shared social graph
  - If micro-sites wanted later, can default activity filter per subdomain
  - Same core value: coordinating group outings with location/route sharing
