    "discussion": "There are two flavors of slab problems to manage in the backcountry right now. The first is relatively small and easy to recognize on the snow surface.  Last week's northerly winds formed thin, hard slabs over the fragile snow surface that is our current January dryspell weak layer.  As this problem was developing last week, skiers and riders triggered five D1 to D1.5 wind slab avalanches on east and northeast aspects near and below treeline, with a few natural avalanches on high-elevation southerly aspects. The broad distribution reflects northerly winds mixing into lower elevations and blowing across the terrain that was holding onto dry, soft snow available for transport.  Now that these drifts have stiffened, they've become stubborn to trigger but are expected to persist because they formed over facets. This problem is also self-policing, as the best riding conditions are found on wind-protected or wind-eroded slopes where slabs are absent.",
